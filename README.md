HTMLDET

The objective of the project is to assist internet users in clarifying suspicious websites by analyzing the URL and also its HTML. The solution contains two ml models for URL and HTML classification. Both models make use of CNN and LSTM techniques with GCN being an addition process to the HTML model. The program will automatically fetch HTML from the given URL in the input.

This project was done during my final year of degree.
